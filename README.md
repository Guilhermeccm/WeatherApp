# WeatherApp
This my first attempt at building a weather app using an API.

Notes:

1 - The API had some issues in the beginning. The key needed a few hours to activate.
2 - Design is quite simple, wasn't trying to waste to much time on this project.
3 - API data in terms of the minimum and maximum temperature of the day is the same which is rather odd but can't do much about it.
